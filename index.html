        <p>South Korea, an East Asian nation on the southern half of the Korean Peninsula, shares one of the world's most heavily militarized borders with North Korea. It's equally known for its green, hilly countryside dotted with cherry trees and centuries-old Buddhist temples, plus its coastal fishing villages, sub-tropical islands and high-tech cities such as Seoul, the capital.</p>
        <p>Every country has its major city, and for Korea that's Seoul (which is also its capital)! Located up towards the northwest part of the country, it's easily one of my favorite metropolitan areas in the whole world.There's just SO much going on no matter what you're looking for, and it's always changing.It's also very easy to see some cool nearby sights in Suwon and Gyeonggido, like a French storybook village, a kitschy island, a huge fortress, and more!</p>
